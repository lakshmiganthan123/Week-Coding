Determine the factors of a number (i.e., all positive integer values that evenly divide into a number) and then return the pth element of the list, sorted ascending. If there is no pth element, return 0.

Example

n = 20

p = 3

The factors of 20 in ascending order are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}. Using 1-based indexing, if p = 3, then 4 is returned. If p > 6, 0 would be returned.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1015

1 ≤ p ≤ 109

The first line contains an integer n, the number to factor.

The second line contains an integer p, the 1-based index of the factor to return.

Sample Case 0

Sample Input 0

10

3

Sample Output 0

5

Explanation 0

Factoring n = 10 results in {1, 2, 5, 10}. Return the p = 3rd factor, 5, as the answer.

Sample Case 1

Sample Input 1

10

5

Sample Output 1

0

Explanation 1

Factoring n = 10 results in {1, 2, 5, 10}. There are only 4 factors and p = 5, therefore 0 is returned as the answer.

Sample Case 2

Sample Input 2

1

1

Sample Output 2

1

Explanation 2

Factoring n = 1 results in {1}. The p = 1st factor of 1 is returned as the answer.
n=int(input())
p=int(input())
ll=[]
for i in range (1,n+1):
    if (n%i==0):
        ll.append(i)
if (p<=len(ll)):
    print(ll[p-1])
else:
    print(0)
